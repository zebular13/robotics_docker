  # The following services are commented out for this tutorial.
  # They demonstrate how to create multiple containers from the same Docker image,
  # each running a specific ROS 2 node. These containers can communicate with each other
  # because they share the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID.
  # Publisher service: Runs the demo talker node
  minimal_publisher:
    <<: *robotics_demo  # This uses all the same settings as the 'manipulation' service
    container_name: minimal_publisher
    command: ["ros2", "run", "demo_nodes_cpp", "talker"]

  # Subscriber service: Runs the demo listener node
  minimal_subscriber:
    <<: *robotics_demo  # This uses all the same settings as the 'manipulation' service
    container_name: minimal_subscriber
    command: ["ros2", "run", "demo_nodes_cpp", "listener"]
